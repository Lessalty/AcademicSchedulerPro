# AcademicSchedulerPro

AcademicSchedulerPro is an advanced Java-based application designed to facilitate the scheduling process within academic institutions. It provides a solution to match professors to courses based on their preferences and qualifications, optimizing the department's course distribution while taking into consideration the seniority and disciplines of the teaching staff.

## Features

- **Generic Priority Queue**: Custom implementation to manage the processing order of professors based on their seniority.
- **Course and Professor Management**: Organize and maintain a list of courses and professors within the department.
- **Matching Algorithm**: Automated algorithm to assign courses to professors, adhering to constraints such as course groups and professor disciplines.
- **Data Persistence**: Load and save professor preferences and available courses from text files.
